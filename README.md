# 🏦 Banking Transactions Management System (Python + Pandas)

This project simulates a real-world banking transactions management system using **Python and Pandas**.  
It includes end-to-end data preparation, analysis, and fraud detection on a realistic multi-table dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to showcase practical skills in data wrangling, merging, anomaly detection, and report generation using structured banking data — including **customers, accounts, branches, and transactions**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Cleaned and structured raw transaction data
- Merged multiple datasets into a unified DataFrame
- Formatted date fields for time-based analysis
- Created KPIs: total volume, customer activity, monthly trends
- Detected and flagged suspicious withdrawal patterns using rule-based logic
- Exported reports to CSV and Excel for business use
- Generated summary documentation (PDF & Word)

---

## 📊 Sample Metrics

- **Total Customers:** 500  
- **Total Transactions:** 10,000  
- **Suspicious Transactions Flagged:** 100  
- **Transaction Volume:** ₵X,XXX,XXX.00+

---

## 🚨 Fraud Detection Logic

Flagged accounts with **3 or more withdrawals in a single day**, and transactions above ₵9,000.  
This logic can easily be extended for more complex rules (e.g., geo-anomalies, round values, frequency spikes).
